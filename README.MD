# Balance IT - Space
This is an open-source re-implementation of my Android game Balance IT - Space. 
I first made this game back in 2012-2013 and that version is still [available at Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.renovelabz.balanceit&hl=en_CA).
This original version was made before I start my bachelor's in Computer Science. Thus, it is not in a state suitable for public consumption. 

This code repository is a re-implementation of that same game using a better designed code base. 
So far, I have completed the implementation of game-play. The development of menus is future work. 
Everything is developed directly on top of the OpenGL ES library available with Android SDK using Java.

The codebase consists of two sections:
 1) [The Game](app/src/main/java/io/github/madhawav/balanceit)
 2) [The Game Engine]((app/src/main/java/io/github/madhawav/gameengine))
