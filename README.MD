# Balance IT - Space

This project is an open-source re-implementation of my Android game Balance IT - Space. 
I made this game back in 2012-2013, and that version is [available at Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.renovelabz.balanceit&hl=en_CA).
I did that work before my bachelor's in Computer Science, and thus, it is not in a state suitable for public consumption.

This code repository is a re-implementation of that same game using a better-designed architecture. 
So far, I have completed the implementation of game-play. 
The development of menus is future work. Everything is developed directly on top of the OpenGL ES library available with Android SDK using Java.

The following is a screenshot from the newly developed version.

The codebase consists of two sections:
 1) [The Game](app/src/main/java/io/github/madhawav/balanceit)
 2) [The Game Engine](app/src/main/java/io/github/madhawav/gameengine)
